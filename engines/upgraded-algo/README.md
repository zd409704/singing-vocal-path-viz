# CHIMERA

A physical-modeling voice synthesizer in the browser. Every sound comes from a simulated
airway (lungs, vocal folds or syrinx, a branched vocal tract, lips, nose), not from samples.
The engine is Rust, compiled to WebAssembly for an AudioWorklet; the same code runs natively
for tests and the `chimera` CLI.

## What it does

- **Play**: drag the tongue, lips and jaw in a live cutaway of the head; vowel pad, encoders,
  computer keyboard and Web MIDI.
- **Speak**: English text (CMUdict with a letter-to-sound fallback) or IPA, turned into
  gestures and prosody, with the gestural score and a consonant chart on screen.
- **Sing**: piano roll with lyrics per note; consonants land before the beat.
- **Beatbox**: pads and a step sequencer, every drum an articulatory gesture.
- **Bestiary**: songbird (two-voice syrinx), seal, alligator and elephant.
- **Duet** (`?show=<id>`): two 3D heads replay a pre-rendered song.

Male, female and child bodies blend continuously. Everything on screen animates from live
engine state: pressure in the airway, airflow, the vocal folds, spectra and formants.

## Run it

Needs Rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, and Bun.

```sh
bun install
bun run dev        # builds the wasm, then Vite on 127.0.0.1:5317
bun run test       # wasm build, cargo test --workspace, bun test tests
```

The AudioWorklet needs a secure context, so open it on localhost or over HTTPS (for example
`tailscale serve`). Vercel builds it with `vercel.json`.

Offline renders and measurement:

```sh
cargo run --release -p chimera-cli -- render speech|text|song|notes|beatbox|creature|vowels …
cargo run --release -p chimera-cli -- diagnose       # nasal leakage, formants, bandwidths, pitch
cargo run --release -p chimera-cli -- compare csd    # against a real singer (docs/csd-comparison.md)
cargo run --release -p chimera-cli -- compare tsp    # against 23 real speakers (docs/speech-comparison.md)
